auto mounting script for Amazon FireTV

Configure the variables to match your share settings and execute with root privileges using a sideloaded script manager capable of doing so.  If you want more than one share use more than one script or feel free to hack it in.  Shares are mounted using adb shell commands locally on the firetv itself.

Worked for me, best of luck to you
